--------------------

Fixed a bug which results in a stack trace when the line length was
too long. (Thanks to radar8)

Maximum line length is now configurable - separately for requirements
and topics.

The 'Solved by' N:1 digraph relation description was added - which can
be used instead of using 'Depends on'.  Even a mix is possible.

LaTeX2 output: changed 'Dependent' to 'Solved by'.


Internal Changes
----------------

Added more test cases.

New TXT file parser was added - but not yet activated, because
currently there is one incompatibility to the old version. Because the
new parser does not allow comments in a value, i.e. comments between
the tag line and a continuation line and between two continuation
lines, this was not activated.
