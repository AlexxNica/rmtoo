Fixed a bug which results in a stack trace when the line length was
too big in a topic. (Thanks to radar8)

Maximum line length is now configurable - separately for requirements
and topics.

The 'Solved by' N:1 digraph relation description was added - which can
be used instead of using 'Depends on'.  Even a mix is possible.

LaTeX2 output: changed 'Dependent' to 'Solved by'.


Internal Changes
