User visible changes:

New tag 'Effort estimation' was added.  This makes it possible to get
an impression about the remaining work to do.  Effort estimation is
also included in the priority lists.  It is directly shown how much
effort it is to implement everything up to a certain priority.

Status values changed from 'open' to 'not done' and from 'completed'
to finished.  This wording fits better for implementation and
requirements elaboration.

A man page was added which describes the format of the requirements
input file. (rmtoo-req-format.5)

Requirements with Class implementable are drawn as octogons in the
requirements dependency graph.

HTML home page is now included in the repository.
