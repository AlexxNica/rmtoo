Added rmtoo-normalize-dependencies tool which converts a set of
requirements from the old 'Depends on' to the new 'Solved by'
notation.

Changed error message from 
 'Missing tag handers for '{'TAGNAME': 'TAGVALUE'}''
to 
 '+++ Error: NN:TAG:No tag handler found for tag(s) '['...']' \
   - Hint: typo in tag(s)?'  
(Thanks to radar8.)

Added Install.txt to tar package.

Added experimental tlp (tulip graph package) output.

Fixed small layout problem in LaTeX files which rendered text after a
subtopic in the same paragraph than the subtopic itself.

Internal Changes
----------------

Text input / output classes were completely rewritten and replace the
old parser. The new classes can be used for writing text files. This
makes it possible that text files can be read in (requirements and
topcs), can be changed programmatically and can then be written back
to the file system. 

Added more automatic regression tests.
