User visible changes
--------------------

Moved directory specification from command line to the
Config.reqs_dir.  This change makes all calls (especially in
Makefiles) incompatible with the new version.

A new command line option '--without-history' was added: When this is
used, there is no history (a la git traceback) done (which is very
time consuming for a big history).
