User visible changes
--------------------

Moved directory specification from command line to the
Config.reqs_dir.  This change makes all calls (especially in
Makefiles) incompatible with the new version.

A new command line option '--without-history' was added: When this is
used, there is no history (a la git traceback) done (which is very
time consuming for a big history).

Internal Changes
----------------

Completely rewrote of the interface to a version control system
o modularized the access: this makes it possible to easily add other
  version control systems.  The first reference implementation is for
  git.
o git-python is currently changing dramatically.  There were API
  changes from 0.1x to 0.2 and there are also some from 0.2 to
  0.3.  Because it is much work (especially testing different
  versions) it was decided to include git-python and the depending
  libraries into the rmtoo package.  When the interface (API) is
  fixed, they will removed.
