Frequently Asked Questions
==========================

* Getting Started with rmtoo

** What is the file format?
   The file should be plain text. The file should contain a sequence
   of details.  Each detail is a group of lines, in name: value
   pairs. For multiline values, indent by one space on the lines 
   after the first. It's possible to leave a blank line between
   requirements, for readability.
   Please consult the rmtoo-req-format(5) man page for further
   information. 

** What tags are supported?
   Currently the following tags are supported:
     Class
     Depends on 
     Description
     Effort estimation
     Invented by
     Invented on
     Name     
     Owner    
     Priority 
     Rationale
     Status
     Type
   For a detailes discussion about the semantic see the
   rmtoo-req-format(5) man page.

** Can I split a large set of requirements into a set of separate files?
   You must - each requirment must go in one file.

** Does a requirement has a unique id?
   Yes - each requirement has an id which is the case sensitive name
   of the file where it's described in - without the suffix.
   Example: file name 'OutputPrio.req' -> id 'OutputPrio'

** Are there any guidelines for the use of 'Id'?
   Just write a unique phrase, the shorter the better.  You can also
   use numbers if you want.
   It's typically easier to handle the requirements when the 'Id'
   gives a hint about the content.

** How do I specify Depends?
   Give only one 'Depends on' field per requirement.
   The value should be the 'Id' of the requirement you are depending on.
   You must specify a 'Depends on' - except of the master requirement.

** How do I put paragraphs in the Rationale?
   To start a new paragraph, write \par at end of the current
   paragraph. This is a \latex\ command.

** Are there any guidlines for the use of Effort estimation?
   The effort estimation is meant to be a symbolic effort point number
   as used in SCRUM.  Please consult the rmtoo-req-format(5) man page
   for detailed information.

** What units are expected in the Effort estimation field?
   None - this is a symbolic number.  See rmtoo-req-format(5) man
   page. 

** What values are valid for the Status field?
   Supported values for the 'Status' field are 'not done' and
   'finished'.  See rmtoo-req-format(5) man page. 

** What values are valid for the Type field?
   Supported values are 'master requirement', 'requirement' and
   'design decision'.  Please consult the rmtoo-req-format(5) man page
   for details.

** What does 'Class' do? How should it be used?
   Class can be one of 'implementable' or 'detailable'.  If a
   requirement is at a detail level that it can be implemented, the
   Class should be set to 'implementable'.  In the other case (the
   default) the requirement must be elaborated and some dependent
   requirements must be defined. Please consult the
   rmtoo-req-format(5) man page for details.

** How should I remove a requirement?
   Remove it from the file system (with rm), then remove it from the
   tip (with 'git rm') then to a checkin.

** Is is possible to rename the rmtoo directory?
   No - this is not possible.  Mostly all python files assume that the
   top level directory is called 'rmtoo'.
