.TH rmtoo-config 5 2010-03-23 "User Commands" "Requirements Management"
.SH NAME
rmtoo-config \- requirements management tool configuration file
.SH DESCRIPTION
One parameter calling the 
.B rmtoo
requirements management tool is the configuration file.  (For a
detailed description about command line parameters see
\fBrmtoo-invoking(1)\fR). 
.P
The configuration file is a python file which must define a class
named \fIConfig\fR.  See the \fBDETAILS\fR section for an explanation
about the configuration parameters.
.SH EXAMPLE
The following example is the configuration file for the 
.B rmtoo
requirements which can be found at \fIrequirements/Config.py\fR.
.sp
.RS
.nf
class Config:
    stakeholders = ["development", "management",
	            "users", "customers"]
    inventors = ["flonatel", ]

    output_specs = \\
        { "latex": ["doc/latex"],
          "prios": ["doc/latex/reqsprios.tex"],
          "graph": ["reqtree.dot"],
          "stats_reqs_cnt": ["doc/latex/stats_reqs_cnt.csv"]
        }

.SH DETAILS
The class \fBConfig\fR must contain some class level variables.
.SS stakeholders
This must be a list of strings specifying the stakeholders.
Stakeholders can own a and prioritize a requirement.  Tags:
\fIOwner\fR and \fIPriority\fR.
.SS inventors
This must be a list of string specifying inventors.  Inventors can
invent a requirement. Tags: \fIInvented by\fR.
.SS output_specs
The variable \fIoutput_specs\fR must be a dictionary (map).  The key
must one of \fIlatex\fR, \fIprios\fR, \fIgraph\fR or
\fIstats_reqs_cnt\fR.  See section \fBOUTPUT\fR for further details.
.SH OUTPUT
The output which 
.B rmtoo
writes out in different formats must be specified with the help of the
\fIoutput_specs\fR variable.  The key describes the artifact to
output, the value is specific to the chosen output parameter.
.SS latex
When \fIlatex\fR is specified as output,
.B rmtoo
outputs a LaTeX document as output.  For a detailed description about
the needed parameters and a detailed description, see
\fBrmtoo-art-latex(1)\fR. 
.SS prios
This outputs a small LaTeX formatted artifact which includes the
priority list and the requirements elaboration list.  For more details
consult \fBrmtoo-art-prio-lists(1)\fR.
.SS graph
When this option is specified a requirements dependency graph is
written.  Please see \fBrmtoo-art-req-dep-graph(1)\fR for more
details.
.SS stats_reqs_cnt
When using \fIgit\fR as the underlying revision control system it is
possible to create a history of the number of requirements.  See
\fBrmtoo-art-reqs-history-cnt(1)\fR for more details.
