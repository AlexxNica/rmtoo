.SH NAME
rmtoo \- requirements management tool
.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.B rmtoo
package is used to read in a set of requirements and create artifacts
from them. 
.SH OVERVIEW
The
.B rmtoo
requirement management tool works on a set of requirements.  It reads
them in, parses them, preprocesses them, checks for syntactic and
semantic problems.  If there is no error found, typically exactly one
artifact is written out.
.P
This page is an overview page.  It gives a short overview over the
.B rmtoo 
parameters.  Also it points to other man pages where information about
input and output files can be found.
.SH INTRODUCTION
The
.B rmtoo
reads in a set of requirements.  These requirements are stored in
different files in the file system.  The files are plain text files
with a special formatting.  The filename's suffix for the requirement
files must be
.I .req
and all files must resist in one directory.
.P
The files are read in.  Then they are parsed: comment and empty lines
are deleted.  From the rest a dictionary of key-value pairs is built.
It is possible to have the value spread over more than one line.
.P
For a detailed specification about the format of the input files, see
the 
.B rmtoo-req-format
man page.
.P
The key-value pairs are internally checked.  If the check succeeds, it
is possible to output a list, graph or other artifact.
