Starting with version 6 rmtoo is also distributed as a Debian
package. 

Documentation is placed under /usr/share/doc/rmtoo

The documentation includes the requirements dependency graph and the
requirements.pdf document from rmtoo itself.

The package also includes the regression and unit tests.
It is possible to run them with:
$ cd /usr/share/pyshared/rmtoo
$ nosetests --verbosity=3 --with-coverage --cover-package=rmtoo

(nosetest might complain about a '[Errno 13] Permission denied',
because the file '.coverage' cannot be written - this can be ignored.) 

Currently about 74% test coverage is reached with the included tests. 

Happy requirements writing!
