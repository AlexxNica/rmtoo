This directory holds the library part of the ODFPY project
(http://odfpy.forge.osor.eu).

Changes:
o The 1.2 grammar file is used (instead of the original 1.1).
  This is needed because some attributes which are needed for
  listboxes (about data sources) are not available in 1.1.
o namespaces.py: the missing namespaces were added.
o element.py was changed in the way, that all known namespaces are
  added.  There is currently a problem with OpenOffice: it aborts if
  only the used namespaces are defined, looks that more / all has to
  be.
