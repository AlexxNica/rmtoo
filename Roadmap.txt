This is a description of the next and next-next generation of to be
implemented features.

There is no exact time line because the amount of time spend for this
tools changes from time to time (depending on many factors).  From
history it may be assumed that it takes about 6 to 8 weeks from one

Also the version number shown here might change: if there are other
requests from customers this will be done first.  Also it might be
that from time to time there is a bug-fix release of rmtoo.
