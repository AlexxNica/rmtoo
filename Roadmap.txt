This is a description of the next and next-next generation of to be
implemented features.

There is no exact time line because the amount of time spend for this
tools changes from time to time (depending on many factors).  From
history it may be assumed that it takes about 6 to 8 weeks from one
version to the next.

Also the version number shown here might change: if there are other
requests from customers this will be done first.  Also it might be
that from time to time there is a bug-fix release of rmtoo.

The history of this file, i. e. the already implemented features can
be found the appropriate release notes.

There are some major aim to go for:
o Get rmtoo listed in the INCOSE tool survey.
o Get rmtoo added to at least one Linux distribution (preferred
  Debian)

  requirements!  Those have to be fixed!
o Man page: add config description for reqs_xxx correct (also FILES
  constant) 
o Man page: add section about environment setup (PYTHONPATH and so on). 
o The output of the topic / html page must in some kind be sorted - to
  get things comparable.
o Document the new command line parameters / Config params
