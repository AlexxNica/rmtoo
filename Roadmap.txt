This is a description of the next and next-next generation of to be
implemented features.

There is no exact time line because the amount of time spend for this
tools changes from time to time (depending on many factors).  From
history it may be assumed that it takes about 6 to 8 weeks from one
version to the next.

Also the version number shown here might change: if there are other
requests from customers this will be done first.  Also it might be
that from time to time there is a bug-fix release of rmtoo.

The history of this file, i. e. the already implemented features can
be found the appropriate release notes.

There are some major aim to go for:
o Get rmtoo listed in the INCOSE tool survey.
o Get rmtoo added to at least one Linux distribution (preferred
  Debian)

IMPORTANT
=========
o Add requirements from Roadmap.
o Rethink about the modules: they should also run (at least partially)
  for the topic based output.  Is there a way to unify this?

v13
===
o Add version information into LaTeX document (front page and
  footer). 
o Enable full statistics for output PDF document.

v14
===
o gantt2 output: order based on topics

v15
===
o finish / write all lost man-pages, e.g.:
  - Man pages for configuration of output modules
    + graph
o Update presentation:
  - Add section about topics
    (Adapt latex output)
  - Add HTML-Output
  - Rewrite graph output
  - Add graph2 output
  - Add code analyze 
    + count in / out
    + topic count
    + word-checking
  - Pricing feature (including creating a graph from the cvs file)
  - version feature
  - Introduction of latex document in the presentation

v16
===
o Add glossary
o Add man page for glossary
o Add glossary to presentation

v17
===
o Increase test case coverage to minimum 90%
o Add test cases for rmtoo-pricing-graph

v18
===
o Add new paragraphs from rmtoo.7 to the presentation.
o Add '10 Gründe rmtoo zu nutzen'
o Add '10 Gründe rmtoo nicht zu nutzen'
o Include sub-graphs in the PDF and HTML documentation
  - Topic based (all reqs of a topic)
  - req based (all reqs dependend and depend on one req)
o Adapt man pages
o Adapt presentation


==> This will be the point of time to get rmtoo into one Linux
    distribution and send out the form to INCOSE.


OTHER / LATER
=============
o output level in 'prios.py' must be configurable
o traceability of changes
o Translations / Intenationalization
  - Input: possible define a new set of tags - one for each language.
o Topic includereqs: There is the need to at least specify ONE
  requirement which is located before all others.
o Add version number to rmtoo -v or something
o Add roadmap feature
o Add ToDo list feature
o History in document: specify two versions and create automatically a
  list of all changed requirements.
o Clean up code (XXX, ToDo, ...)
o Use MemLog instead of print.
o 'The only requirement management tool which comes with the
  requirements for the tool'. 
o A requirement cannot be 'finished' if on of the dependent is not
  finished.
